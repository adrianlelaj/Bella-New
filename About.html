			Isabella Costantino grew up in Toronto, Canada training at Sean Boutilier Academy of Dance. There, she rigorously trained to complete her Classical Ballet - Cecchetti Method Examinations up to Advanced II under the instruction of Sheona Bell. Isabella then began her professional training at The Boston Conservatory at Berklee in 2017. She will graduate in May 2021 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Contemporary Dance with a minor in Creative Entrepreneurship. At The Conservatory, she has had the opportunity to perform new works by Loni Landon and Daniel Pelzig among others, as well as performing a reconstruction of “Paquita” set by Adriana Suarez and Gianni Di Marco. Isabella also serves as the Dance Division Representative on Student Government Association where she represents the student body by vocalizing their concerns. To continue expanding her dance training, she will be spending this summer at (Orsolina28 or Arts Umbrella), and spent last summer at Transformation Danse Montreal. During these intensives she has performed works by Crystal Pite, Ohad Naharin. Moving forward with her professional career Isabella hopes to continue artistically immersing herself in this art form.
